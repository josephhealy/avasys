Most such vendors make the majority of their revenue consulting to deliver custom, one-off installs of their 'product'. Don't be fooled.</div>

These methodologies are designed to tear down walls between project stakeholders, operate in small teams without detailed upfront requirements, and focus on continuous delivery. 'Waterfall' approaches focus on 'Big Design Up Front', tend to have larger, more structured teams, and many 'checks and balances'. While agile / lean are very popular, waterfall still has a place for some very large scale, monolithic, and / or life-critical applications such as avionics, medical devices, air traffic control, and taxation.</div>

                                            <div>Team size is a much belabored question. The answer is typically driven by how self-contained teams are, their level of interaction, and proposed development methodology. Traditional 'waterfall' approaches are usually hierarchically structured with strict interactions between various stakeholders and tend to be comprised of larger, often distributed, teams. 'Agile / Lean' approaches on the other hand are far less structured and stakeholders are more 'intimately' involved on a day-to-day basis so teams tend to be more compact to avoid them becoming unwieldy. </div>

What's it take to work offshore with a high level of confidence? Short answer - your subject matter experts have to be highly available, your technical oversight exceptionally talented and patient, and someone has to spend regular (monthly?) face-to-face time with the offshore team in-person or video conferencing. One caveat: it's all but impossible to map Agile / Lean methodologies offshore despite insistent claims to the contrary.</div>
